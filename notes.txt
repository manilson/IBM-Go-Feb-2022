Software Requirements:
    1. Go (go.dev/dl)
    2. Visual Studio Code

Why Go?
    1. Better Performance (fact : go performance is equivalent to 'C')
    2. Simplicity
    3. Scalability
    4. Lesser Compilation Time
    5. 

Paradox of Choice (Barry Schwartz)

    1. Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
            a. No access modifiers
            b. No classes (Only structs & functions)
            c. No inheritance (Only composition)
            d. No pointer arithmetic
            e. Everything is a value (no implicit/builtin reference type)
            f. No implicit type conversion
    2. As powerful as 'C' without the overheads of 'C'
        a. Go has a builtin garbage collector
        b. Compiled to Native code
        c. Fast compilation
    3. Built for concurrency
        Language features built for concurrency
            go, range, select, channel (data type), <- (channel operator)
            sync package
        100s of goroutines can be executed using 1 OS thread

concurrency
    The ability to have more than one 'execution path' in the application


func f1(){

}

func f2(){

}

go f1()
f2()
